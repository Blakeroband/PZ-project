        <h2 class="banner">New Game</h2>
        <p>Once you start a new game, solo or multiplayer, you will be given a list of choices.</p>
        <p>You will need to decide</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Playstyle</li>
            <li>Challenges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like to start with the custom sandbox playstyle and tailor the game to my personal preferences. move on from there.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2 class="banner">Spawn Selection</h2>
        <p>After choosing your playstyle it's time to choose your spawn!</p>
        <p>The best place for a new beginner is Riverside</p>
        <p>Riverside is the best beginner spawn for a few reasons</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Low Zombie Population</li>
            <li>Diverse areas to loot</li>
            <li>Good starting base in the Gated community to the south</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="banner">Character Creation</h2>
        <p>Upon Starting a new save, you will have to decide what stats your character spawns with</p>
        <p>Picking negative traits does not nessesarily equal a negative experience. There are a few negative traits that are very worth while. Negative traits give you additional points to spend on positive traits. One of the negative traits that I like is "underweight". This perk causes you to start with less weight on your bones, it does have drawbacks, but it is very easy to fix. Just eat a lot of food on day one and you'll be good to go in no time.</p>

        <h2 class="banner">First Day</h2>
        <p>Congrats! You are already dead! No, I'm serious, accept that you are going to die. this game is meant to be miserable. You will make mistakes. You will make stupid decisons. BUT you will have fun doing it! Every win feels like a checkpoint, however there are no checkpoints, so live the best you can and die honorably!</p>
        <img src="Placeholder" alt="Placeholder">
        <p>when you first take control of your player character, check the house you spawn in, usually you will find some food, maybe a weapon if you're lucky and at the very least, it's a safe place to run back to if things get crazy... for now. You should watch the tv every morning and evening to gain skills from the "life and living" tv channel, so FIND A TV. Your first day will consist of (in no particular order)</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Find a TV</li>
            <li>Find some food and get munching!</li>
            <li>look for a weapon, check garages, sheds, sometimes bedrooms</li>
            <li>get some armor! check the bite and scratch protection and start layering up</li>
            <li>drink water often!</li>
            <li>find somewhere safe to base up, clear zombies around a stronghold and make a temporary camp</li>
        </ul>
